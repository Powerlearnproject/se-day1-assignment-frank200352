Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a process of designing, developing, testing and maintenance of software systems in a structurd and functional for users.
It also involves the use of engineering principles, methods and tools to design, develop and maintain high quality software systems.
Software enginnering is very important in the technology industry to validate the creation of applications and systems software in order to ease the work of users in all various works of life such as health care, entertainment, commerce, communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the evolution of key milestones of software engineering are
1. In 1960s, the development of programming languages such as fortran, c, cobol etc and as well establishment of software engineering as a discipline
2. In 1970s, the advent of structured programming languages
3. In 2000s, the rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement phase: this is the gathering and documenting of user needs and systems requirement.
2. Design phase: in this phase, creation of high levele and well detailed designs of software architecture and the user interface.
3. Implimentation phase: this is the phase of building and writing of the codes of the software according to design specification.
4. Testing phase: this is where various test are carried out to ensure the software meets quality standard
5. Deployment phase: this is where the softwares are being release to users or customers.
6. Maintenance phase: this is where support are being provided, more feature updates and enhancements to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a software development approach where application and system softwares are been process in a sequential approach with diverse phases such as ( requirement, design and implementation) while
Agile methodology is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration and respond change, it follows the iterative as well as increamental approach that emphasizes on the importance of develivery working product very quickly.
It help teams strike a healthy balance between structure and flexibility, also where teams reflect and look back to see if there was anything that could be improved so they can adjust there strategy for next project.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer is responsible for building and writing codes for software solutions and implimentation
2. Quality Assurance Engineer ensures the software quality by designing and executing the test plans
3. Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of the software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The importance of IDEs( Integrated Development Environments)
 it gives all the necessary tools in a single location and avoids incompatibility concerns between multiple compilers and target systems eg VS code, Intellije IDEA
Integrated development environments (IDEs) boost developer productivity, decrease installation time and accelerate development activities by keeping developers informed of the most current threats, best practices, and standardizing the development cycle so everyone can participate.
It help software developers to consider their actions in terms of the complete software development life cycle (SDLC) instead of a number of different activities.
The importance of VCS (Version Control Systems)
It help software developers to keep track of every change made to the code
It create regular and automated backups whenever copies a repository using a version control system
We can protect the data from loss in the event of a server failure by having numerous backups on various workstations


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Pressure from tight deadline in the delivery of the software applications or systems resulting to compromised quality
   strategies to overcome this is to prioritized task and work on the development within stipulated time
2. changing in requirement, changes in requirement may occur during development cycle and this can lead to delay of project
   strategies to overcome this is effective communication 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
   Its important to ensure the modules of software quality meet the requirement standard
2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
   Its importance to test integration testing for seamless and compactibilty of different components
3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
   Its important to carry out this testing to ensure the functionality of software
4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
   Its important to carry out this test to ensure that the needs of user is achieved


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about structuring your query in a certain format that suit the content of your problem from AI models
Prompt enginnering helps by making your querry or asking clear, specific and structure in such a way that AI will understand.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
This is a example of a vague question, what is programming languages?
improvement is as an experienced programmer, define programming languages. Make the definition easy to understand for a student that does not have a knowledge of programming
